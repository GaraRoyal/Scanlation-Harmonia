# Scanlation Harmonia

*Very* WIP scanlation management app, meant to let you keep track of translations, styling, and progress. So far this is mostly aimed at the translator, but further in development I'm planning on making it more accesible to the TS, PR, and other members of the team.


## Get started

Uses a combination of node and svelte, run `npm run start` to kick off both the front-end and back-end services (opens by default on port 5000). 

## Status

Barely an MVP at the moment, there is no styling or anything. This is currently just to keep track of progress as well as a point of backup.
